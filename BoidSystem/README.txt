README: 6.837 Assignment3 - Kimberly Toy

Instructions: 
- Unzip file
- 'cd Assignment3_KToy'
- To run the application, type ./a3 <type of integrator: 'e', 't', or 'r'> <step size>
For example: ./a3 t 0.02f
runs the simulation for the trapezoidal integrator and a step size of 0.02f
- To move the cloth, you can press 'r', and the simulation will start over. 
- All three simulations (simple system, pendulum, and cloth) will display at once. You don't have to do anything to switch simulations.  Also, they will all run off of the same integrator that you chose at the beginning. 

*I did not collaborate with anyone.

*There are no known problems with my code at least on Mac.  

*Extra Credit: I implemented a wind force, which you can turn on and off by pressing 'w'.
