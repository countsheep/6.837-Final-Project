Goals for Thursday
---------------------
K - move function
K - main method update
E - (attempt) render boids as models/cloths
K - (non-raytraced) implement find camera pos that views entire bounding box
user interactivity ->
* closest parallel xyz axis-plane, user can move a boid along that plane (should disable that boid's move function and override the user data)
* force sphere that pushes boids out
E - 	(1) - Closest parallel axis thing (take camera up vector * by each axis, pick plane that lies on axises that up vector is most perpedicular to, random tiebreaker)
E -		(2) - mouse tracking?
K -		(3) - integrate mouse tracking and move function
K -		(4) - force sphere as a force

Working on by Friday 
--------------------
ray tracing 
lights/lighting, shading (specular/diffuse), shadowss
 - camera movement (bind to keys)
 - shadows mapping 

Possibilities
---------------------
Different kinds of boids - competition
Interesting backgrounds/models 
bird bait "leader of boid"
different shapes of bounding boxes (snowglobe)
fireflies (each boid is a light source)
boid particles set boundaries for the light source (a mass of contained light)
